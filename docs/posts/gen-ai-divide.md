The GenAI Divide
STATE OF AI IN
BUSINESS 2025

> Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising
result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly
divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors,
consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting
millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This
divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be
determined by approach.

> Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have
explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. 

Průzkum a nasazení ani zdaleka nemusí znamenat, že se nástroje reálně využívají. Podle zkušeností Harvard AI Sandbox, a našich je jen malá část uživatelů reálně aktivních.

> The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most
GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time.

Je to stejně s jiným úspěšným software?

> A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these
limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and
evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect
systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time.

> While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have
crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer
support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-
performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and
external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer
retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up
systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at
specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring.
