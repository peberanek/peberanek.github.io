# AI a velká očekávání (4)

(Zvýraznění níže jsou moje.)

> Dear President von der Leyen,
>
> **We, experts in artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal impacts, are deeply concerned about
> your unscientific and inaccurate statement that AI is nearing human reasoning.** You claimed
> in your budget speech in May "we thought AI would only approach human reasoning around
> 2050. Now we expect this to happen already next year."
>
> We understand from Commission disclosure, which followed a lengthy process to obtain this
> information, that you relied on the statements of Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang and Sam
> Altman as the basis for your statement about AI nearing human reasoning. **These are
> marketing statements driven by profit-motive and ideology rather than empirical evidence
> and formal proof. In short, these tech CEOs claims concerning “superintelligence” and “AGI”
> are manifestly bound with their financial imperatives and not rigorous science.**  
>
> For the President of the European Commission to repeat the misleading marketing language
> of US technology firms without independent scientific verification undermines Europe’s
> credibility as a reliable and trusted source of scientific knowledge. This is particularly so
> amidst a significant speculative bubble to which baseless AI hype is contributing.
