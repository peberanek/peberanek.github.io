# AI jako spolupracovník

> Can AI take over some of [my] tasks? The answer is yes, and frankly, there are tasks that I wouldn't mind offloading to AI, like administrative paperwork. But does that mean my job will vanish? Not really. Getting rid of some tasks doesn't mean the job disappears. In the same way, power tools didn't eliminate carpenters but made them more efficient, and spreadsheets let accountants work faster but did not eliminate accountants. AI has the potential to automate mundane tasks, freeing us for work that requires uniquely human traits such as creativity and critical thinking–or, possibly, managing and curating the AI's creative output[.]

> However, this isn't the end of the story. The systems within which we operate play a crucial role in shaping our jobs as well. [...] Let's say an AI can deliver a lecture better than I can. Would students be willing to outsource their learning to AI? [...] Would the deans of the university feel comfortable using AI in this way? Would the magazines and sites that rank schools punish us for doing so? My job is connected to many other jobs, customers and stakeholders. Even if AI automates my job, the systems in which it works are less obvious.
