# Intelligence Augmentation

> Doug Endelbart, one of the pioneers of [human-computer interaction] championed the idea of intelligence augmentation - IA rather then AI. He believed that **computers should augment human abilities rather than automate away human tasks**. In 1968, Engelbart's "mother of all demos" showed off for the first time the computer mouse, a windowing system, hypertext, and video conferencing - all in an effort fot demonstrate what human knowledge workers could **collectively accomplish with some intelligence augmentation**.
