# Brains and Computers

(Zvýraznění níže jsou moje.)

> Brains and digital computers have somewhat different properties. [...] computers have a cycle time that is a million times faster than a brain. The brain makes up for that with far more storage and interconnection than even a high-end personal computer, although the largest supercomputers match the brain on some metrics. Futurists make much of these numbers, [...] But the comparisons of raw numbers are not especially informative. **Even with a computer of virtually unlimited capacity, we still require further conceptual breakthroughs in our understanding of intelligence. [...] Crudely put, without the right theory, faster machines just give you the wrong answer faster**.
