# AI jako akcelerátor toxické kultury

> ... whatever actions AIs may _one day_ take if they develop their own desires, they are already being
used instrumentally by social-media companies, advertisers, foreign agents, and
regular people—and in ways that will deepen many of the pathologies already
inherent in internet culture. On Sydney’s list of things it might try, stealing launch
codes and creating novel viruses are the most terrifying, but making people argue
until they kill one another is something social media is already doing.
