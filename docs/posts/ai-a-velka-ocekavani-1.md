Moreover, their ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until - in a visible future - the range of problems they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which the human mind ha been applied.

> The term "visible future" is vague, but Simon also made more concrete predictions: that within 10 years a computer would be chess champion and a significant mathematical theorem would be proved by machine. **These predictions came true (or approximately true) within 40 years rather than 10.** Simon's overconfidence was due to the promising performance of early AI systems on simple examples. In almost all cases, however, these early systems failed on more difficult problems.
